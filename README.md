### Freeware B777-300ER aircraft simulation for X-Plane 11
### Over 10,000 downloads - Started on October 26, 2016

The digital simulation of the <b>Boeing 777-300ER</b> is a hobby I have been working on, developing my skills as a researcher, 3D modeller and coder - including a <b>high fidelity 3D cockpit</b>. I decided to create this aircraft after not being satisfied with the already existing downloads and made it <b>free</b> for everyone who shared the same want.\
\
The result is a massive seven year open-source project with over hundreds of manhours dedicated to it, over 5 programming languages used, hundred of thousands of vertices, and more than a thousand lines of code rewritten and iterated up on again and again.\
\
<i>This is in early development and therefore is not representable of what the finished product will be like.</i>
